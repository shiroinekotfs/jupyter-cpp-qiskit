# Qiskit header for Jupyter C++ kernel

```markdown
This project is an add-on of another project: C++ kernel for Jupyter
Visit here: https://github.com/shiroinekotfs/jupyter-cpp-kernel
```

Qiskit is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and primitives.

For more information about the Qiskit Quantum Computing, check it out [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit)

## Getting started

### Minimum Requirements

By default, this add-on already fixes all minimum requirements before preform any actual run. However, for best practice, you should also install [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook), or [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab).

### Installing Qiskit header for C++ kernel

For new user, you can try one of these installation type, to get Qiskit header

#### From PyPI (not published yet)

You can try install this header from PyPI

```bash
pip install jupyter-cpp-qiskit
```

If your kernel installed with `all-users` mode, try to use `sudo` command

```bash
sudo pip install jupyter-cpp-qiskit
```

#### From GitHub

You can try install this header from GitHub repo

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/shiroinekotfs/jupyter-cpp-qiskit.git
```

If your kernel installed with `all-users` mode, try to use `sudo` command

```bash
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/shiroinekotfs/jupyter-cpp-qiskit.git
```

## Development

For better development, try to clone this repo, then edit the header.
